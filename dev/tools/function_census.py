"""How heavy is each FUNCTION — by length, and by decisions.

**Why this exists.**  ``class_census.py`` weighs a class by the methods it
implements, so it is blind to what those methods CONTAIN: measured 2026-09-19,
``uc_led_control._setup_ui`` is **585 lines** and no gate in the repo had an
opinion about it.  ``class_census`` also walks ``ClassDef`` only, so a
module-level function is invisible to it entirely — and two of the densest
functions in the tree are module-level.

**Two axes, because they measure different defects and barely overlap.**
At ``>100 lines`` and ``>=20 decisions``: 22 functions are only long, 2 are
only branchy, 5 are both.

* **lines** — a function you cannot hold in your head.  ``LoadTheme.execute``
  at 342.
* **decisions** — paths you must reason about and test.  ``format_metric`` is
  **70 lines with 30 decisions**, and a length gate cannot see it at all.

A length gate alone misses the densest logic; a decision gate alone misses the
585-line builders.  Neither is a superset, so both are reported.

**What counts as a decision, and what deliberately does not.**  ``if`` /
``while`` / ``except`` / ternary / ``match`` case / ``for`` / each extra
``and``-``or`` operand.  A COMPREHENSION counts as its loop and nothing more:
counting its ``if``s too inflated ``ipc._coerce`` from 20 to 26 and
``auto_map`` from 15 to 25, which ranked compact functional code alongside
genuinely tangled branching.  ``with`` and ``assert`` do not count — neither
is a path the reader chooses between.

**The weight is on the function's OWN body.**  A nested ``def`` is weighed
separately, and its lines and decisions are NOT also charged to its parent —
otherwise a factory would be penalised twice for the same code, and the API's
route factory (whose endpoints are nested ``def``s) would dominate a list it
does not belong on.

**Scope defence.**  An unparseable file RAISES rather than being skipped —
same reasoning ``class_census`` documents: the file a census cannot read is
exactly the one being edited.

Usage::

    PYTHONPATH=src python3.12 dev/tools/function_census.py
    PYTHONPATH=src python3.12 dev/tools/function_census.py --lines 140
    PYTHONPATH=src python3.12 dev/tools/function_census.py --decisions 18
    PYTHONPATH=src python3.12 dev/tools/function_census.py --area core

``tests/test_function_weight.py`` imports :func:`too_long` and
:func:`too_branchy` and ratchets both, so the tool and the gate can never
measure different things.
