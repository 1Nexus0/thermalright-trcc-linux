"""What does screen capture do on the desktop I am sitting in, right now?

Composes the SHIPPING chain for this session, reports it, and takes one real
frame.  Ten seconds on each desktop, instead of launching the GUI and driving
it by hand.

    PYTHONPATH=src python3.12 dev/check_capture.py

Written 2026-09-18, after a change that composes the capture chain per display
session (portal + one tool on Wayland, Qt's grab + the X11 tools on X11) left
the maintainer needing to log into GNOME and XFCE to see whether it still
worked.  This answers that without a GUI.

**What it proves and what it does not.**  It proves the session is detected
correctly, that a sane chain is composed, and that a frame with real pixels
comes back.  It does NOT drive the LCD, so a wire-level problem is out of
scope -- for that, run the app.

On Wayland the portal may ask for consent.  Approve it and the run continues;
a refusal is reported as a refusal, not a crash.
