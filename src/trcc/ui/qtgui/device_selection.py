"""DeviceSelection — the ONE device a window is working on.

**Why this exists.**  qtgui gave every panel its own
:class:`~trcc.ui.qtgui.device_picker.DevicePickerWidget` — ten of them — and
nothing kept them in sync.  ``DevicePickerWidget.set_key`` was written for
exactly that sync ("programmatic set_key calls don't emit, so panels can sync
state without thrashing") and had **zero production callers**.  Driven on a
two-device fleet: pick the second device in Preview and the overlay editor
still edits the first, silently, so every element added lands on the wrong
screen.  One device hides it completely, because each picker independently
defaults to index 0 and they agree by accident.

**Why it is view state and not a Setting.**  Which device a *window* is
currently editing is not app state — it is not persisted, it is not shared
with the CLI, and a second window would legitimately want its own.  ``ui/gui``
models it the same way, as ``TRCCApp._active_key``; there is deliberately no
``selected_device`` anywhere in ``Settings`` or the Command surface.

**Why one per KIND.**  An LCD workspace and an LED workspace are different
contexts — ``ui/gui`` makes them different top-level views — so selecting an
LCD must not blank the LED panel.  MainWindow owns one of these per kind and
hands each panel the one matching its filter.
