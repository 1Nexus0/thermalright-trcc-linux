"""A portrait-MOUNTED panel must start at 90 degrees, once.

Two reporters with the same cooler -- PM=11 SUB=5, 854x480 -- described the
same thing in different words: #203 "wont orientate properly ... I can make it
work by going 270", #262 "load-image fills the entire physical panel correctly,
but content appears rotated ~90 degrees".  Their panel is bolted into the
cooler sideways, the SUB byte says so, and we already resolved that at
handshake into ``DeviceProfile.portrait_mounted`` -- whose only consumer was a
string in the log.

The C# spends the same byte immediately: ``SetThemeInfo_ThemeML`` seeds
``themeDirection = 90`` and the portrait catalog when ``pmSub >= 5``, so a
vendor-app owner never sees the sideways picture at all.

THE SAFETY PROPERTY IS THE HALF WORTH GUARDING.  Seeding is first-boot only.
An owner who has already worked around this by setting 270 by hand has
persisted DeviceSettings, and re-seeding them would overwrite the workaround
with a different wrong answer on upgrade.  The C# gates on
``themeDirection == -1``; we gate on "no persisted entry for this key".

MUTATION CHECK -- in ``Settings.seed_mount_orientation``, delete the
``if key in self._devices:`` early return so every connect re-seeds.

MEASURED: **3 failed, 4 passed** -- ``[0]``, ``[180]`` and ``[270]`` of
``test_an_already_configured_device_is_never_reseeded``, while both first-boot
tests still pass.  ``[90]`` survives on purpose and is worth understanding: a
re-seed writes 90, the saved value IS 90, so the assertion cannot see the
difference.  That is why the parametrisation carries all four angles instead of
one -- a single-value version of this test written with 90 would guard nothing.

A mutation that only breaks the safety half is invisible to any test that
checks the feature half, and the feature half is the easy one to write.
