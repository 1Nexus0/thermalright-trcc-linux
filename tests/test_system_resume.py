"""Resume-from-suspend reconnect (#189).

After the machine sleeps, the USB transport a device opened beforehand is stale
on wake — writes silently no-op, so the panel stays blank until a manual
restart.  ``App`` subscribes to ``SystemResumed`` (published by the logind
PrepareForSleep listener) and rebuilds each attached device like a replug: stop
the old sender, release the stale transport, ``ConnectDevice`` to re-handshake +
start a fresh sender.  These pin that the device comes back AND can send again,
without dropping its active theme / LED state.

    ``App.__init__`` and running the whole suite: **4830 passed.**  The entire

    notice, because it asserts a STATE that holds on both sides of the event
    rather than the TRANSITION the handler exists to perform.

    The transition is observable without simulating a dead USB node:
    ``_on_system_resumed`` disconnects the stale instance and dispatches
    ``ConnectDevice``, which attaches a NEW one.  So identity changes, and the
    old object is left disconnected — neither is true if the handler never ran.
