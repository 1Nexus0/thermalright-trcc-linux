"""The REQUEST half of every handshake — what we PUT on the wire.

The fourth axis of the device-coverage set ``test_device_surface_matrix.py``
names.  Those three all watch what comes BACK:

  * ``test_device_catalog_smoke.py`` — every variant CONNECTS on a scripted reply.
  * ``test_*_lcd_geometry.py`` — the reply parses to the right canvas.
  * ``test_device_surface_matrix.py`` — a frame renders and reaches the wire.

**THIS** watches what goes OUT first: the init packet each ``connect()`` writes,
and the size it asks back.  Nothing did, and the fake transport cannot notice —
``FakeBulkTransport.read()`` pops ``read_script[0]`` on the first read of any
size, unconditioned on what was written, so a completely wrong init packet still
gets a perfect reply and every downstream assertion passes.  Measured before this
file existed, of six handshake variants the request bytes were asserted for
**one** (HID Type 3, ``test_f5_protocol.py``); ``_build_init_packet_type2`` and
``Led._build_init_packet`` had zero test references anywhere in the tree.

The expected bytes are transcribed from the decompile, with the citation on the
row — never rebuilt from the constant under test, which is the trap
``mock_platform.ly_reply``'s docstring records paying for: a harness that
restates the implementation agrees with a defect for as long as it exists.

**The wire component is a different binary.**  ``TRCC.exe`` composes; the USB
senders live in ``USBLCDNEW.dll``, so citations below are to
``DCReadWriteAsync.cs`` in the ``USBLCDNEW`` decompile except LED, which
handshakes from ``TRCC.exe`` itself.  SCSI has **no managed oracle at all** —
``USBLCD.exe`` is native — which is stated on that test rather than papered over.

**Endpoints are deliberately not an oracle claim.**  ``PyUsbBulkTransport.write``
resolves the endpoint from the device's own descriptors and falls back to the
argument only when discovery found nothing (``transport.py:273``), so a class's
``_EP_WRITE`` is a default, not what reaches the wire.  The C# hardcodes EP09 for
LY where we pass 0x01 and that is NOT a divergence.  What IS checked here is that
exactly one write happens, carrying exactly these bytes.

MUTATION CHECK — 14 mutations of the SHIPPING code, MEASURED 2026-09-10, every
one caught: the bulk magic, the bulk read size, the Type-2 pad, the Type-2
command byte's index, the Type-2 response size, the LED command byte's index,
the LED report size, the LY pad, the LY read size, the SCSI poll command word,
the SCSI init payload no longer being zeros, and dropping a row from the table
(which fails the completeness test too).  The LY pair fails two rows each,
correctly — ``LyLcd`` serves both PIDs.  The two ``_f5`` mutations pass HERE and
fail ``test_f5_protocol.py::test_f5_constants_are_the_decompiled_values``, which
is the arrangement the comment above the literals describes.

Two of those mutations survived the first draft of this file, both for the same
reason: the row derived its expectation from the constant it was testing, so the
request and the expectation moved together.  That is the failure this whole file
exists to prevent, reproduced in the file itself on the first try.
