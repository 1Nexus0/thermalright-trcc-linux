"""God classes may only decrease — the ratchet.

**Why this is enforced rather than remembered.**  ``ui/qtgui`` was measured
at ZERO classes over 25 implemented methods on 2026-09-15.  Two days later
``SystemPanel`` was at 28 — six unrelated concerns in one widget — and
nothing failed, because nothing was watching.  Every gate in this repo
asserts logging, imports, types or docs; none of them had an opinion about a
class growing without bound.

Like :mod:`tests.test_logging_coverage` it cannot start green: eleven
classes are over the line today.  Failing on all of them would put CI
permanently red, which is how a gate gets ignored.  So it is a **ratchet**:

* a class crosses the line -> the count rises -> **fail**
* a class is decomposed or removed -> the count falls -> **fail**, asking you
  to lower :data:`MAX_GOD_CLASSES` so the ground gained cannot be given back

The weight is methods that have an IMPLEMENTATION; ``dev/tools/class_census.py``
documents why an ``@abstractmethod`` does not count and what counting raw
methods would have done to the two ports.  The threshold is passed
explicitly from here, so it cannot be raised quietly in the tool.
