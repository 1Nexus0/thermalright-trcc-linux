"""Cache HEALTH — what the real key derivation does to the real cache.

``test_bg_mask_cache`` covers the data structure: the byte budget, eviction
order, the working-set decline.  It hands the cache its own hand-built keys,
so it cannot see the thing that actually breaks — what
``DisplayService._bg_mask_key`` derives for a real workload, and what the
cache then does with it.

Three workloads, three shapes, and each fails differently:

* **static** — one entry, and every tick after the first is a HIT.  Getting
  this wrong costs a full compose per tick forever; nothing looks broken.
* **cyclic** (a video) — the cursor is in the key, so N frames make N entries
  and the second lap HITs.  Getting it wrong the other way is the "LCD frozen
  on the first frame" bug: the key stops moving, every tick HITs, and the
  panel shows frame 0 while the cursor advances underneath.
* **live** (a screen capture) — a key that never repeats.  It must not reach
  the cache at all.

**Why the live case is pinned now, while nothing renders that way.**  A live
source through the cached path is 100% miss forever AND evicts the entries
that would have hit, so a screencast running on one device degrades every
other source on it.  That surfaces as "the panel got slower after the
refactor" and **no other gate in this repo would see it** —
``dev/tools/wire_baseline.py`` is provably blind to it (a cache-key mutation
moves 0 of its 228 rows, measured).  This is the tripwire for the background
slot unification, so it is mutation-checked rather than assumed: caching every
capture under a never-repeating key fails both live pins.

That mutation had to be fixed before it proved anything -- the first version
keyed on ``id(frame)``, and CPython recycles the id of a collected object, so
the "unique" keys collided, no eviction pressure built, and the eviction pin
passed while the bug was present.  A mutation that does not do what it claims
is indistinguishable from a guard that works.
