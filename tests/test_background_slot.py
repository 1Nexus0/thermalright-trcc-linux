"""BackgroundSlot — the current picture, and the token that proves it is current.

Two halves, and the second is the one that matters.

**The value**: a slot hit means ``_resolve_background`` does not run, so the
background file is not re-opened.  That is narrower than it sounds and worth
stating exactly: when the bg+mask cache HITS, ``_build_bg_mask`` is never
called and the slot is not consulted at all.  The slot earns its keep on the
misses where the SOURCE did not change but the way it is drawn did — rotate
the panel, toggle the mask, change the fit — which today re-opened and
re-decoded the same file every time.

**The guard**: the slot is read BY TOKEN, and a mismatch resolves rather than
serving what is there.  Without that check a per-device slot is a trap: render
theme X while the slot holds theme Y's background and you get Y's picture
under X's mask and X's metrics, silently, with a cache entry to keep it.
``SceneCache`` and ``BgMaskCache`` already store a value beside the key that
produced it and check on the way out; this does the same.
