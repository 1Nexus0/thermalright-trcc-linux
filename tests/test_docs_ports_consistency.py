"""Docs must describe the ports that exist.

``doc/REFERENCE_PORTS.md`` is how a contributor learns what to extend: which
ABC, what to implement, what comes free, how to register.  Before it existed,
the only map was a hand-written table in CLAUDE.md that listed **four** ports
when the tree had **28** — and two of those four pointed at files that no
longer contained them (``UsbTransport`` in ``adapters/device/hid.py``, a class
that does not exist; ``SegmentDisplay`` in ``adapters/device/led_segment.py``,
which had moved to ``services/``).

Adding a cooler is two table rows and a new wire is three methods, but nothing
said so — so only the author knew.  A contract nobody can find is not a
contract, which is why the page is generated and these guard it.

Same contract as the man pages and the CLI reference: the committed copy must
match what the generator produces right now.

    explodes in ``issubclass`` with ``arg 1 must be a class``.

    The real one was ctypes: it caches every array type behind such a proxy,
    and the cached type wears the ``__module__`` of whichever module first
    evaluated ``c_uint8 * 32``.  Usually that is ``pynvml``, whose name this
    sweep ignores — but when ``adapters/sensors/_smc.py`` got there first, the

    import order, so under ``pytest -n`` it was whichever worker drew
    ``tests/test_sensors_macos.py``: the page the module header calls
    deterministic was a coin flip, and it cost a contributor a bug report they
    could only describe as an environment difference.
