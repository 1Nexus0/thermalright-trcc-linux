"""Event fan-out over the daemon socket (Phase B, increment 4).

Daemon mode had Command dispatch and no events at all, which is why a GUI
cannot be a pure bus client: both skins build a ``BusBridge`` from
``app.events``, and ``AppProxy`` has no such attribute.  This is the server
half -- a client can now ask for a stream and receive real events.

What is pinned here is the behaviour a reader cannot see from the code: that
the handler does not do the work, that one event is encoded once for many
listeners, that a dead client is evicted rather than blocking the daemon, and
that a full queue drops events instead of growing memory.
